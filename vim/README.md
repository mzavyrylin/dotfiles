#My Own Vim Configuration

It's indeed a vim config with plugins and color schemes.
The internals's structure is inspired by Derek Wyatt.

You can install it like this:
* Delete your `~.vimrc` and `~/.vim` if they're exist
* `git clone https://github.com/mzavyrylin/vimrc.git ~/.vim`
* `cd ~/.vim/bundle && ./get.sh`
* `ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~./vimrc`
* Thats it. Enjoy!
